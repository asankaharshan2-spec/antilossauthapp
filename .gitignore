# AntiLossApp - Firebase Prototype

This is a ready-to-build Android Studio project skeleton for the **AntiLossApp** prototype.
It includes basic Device Admin enrollment, Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Messaging),
contacts & location backup helpers, WorkManager heartbeat, and SMS fallback.

IMPORTANT:
- Replace `app/google-services.json` with your Firebase project's `google-services.json`.
- Update `SmsReceiver.TRUSTED` in `SmsReceiver.kt` with your phone number in E.164 format if using SMS fallback.
- Test WIPE only on disposable devices.
